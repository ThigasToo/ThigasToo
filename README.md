My name is Thiago Cunha, and this are some things about me:

-  I’m currently working on this transaction fraud detection app! 💱
-  I’m currently deepening my knowledge in ML through a Stanford specialization! 📚
-  I’m looking to collaborate on financial and fiscal analysis with Machine Learning 💰
-  Fun fact: you can find some non-work related code in the 'personal_projects' folder ⚡
